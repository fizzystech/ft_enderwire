# ft_enderwire
This is the FizzysTech take on the Enderwire conversion

This conversion is a modified version of DaRk_dOg's (boubounokefalos) conversion with a number of updates we all think should be made to the Switchwire.

We have incorporated the Nevermore V4 filter into the design and other changes from the stock design will be added in due time.

Umbilical mods to both the XZ and Y axis have been incorporated with the help of TheVoronModder (Kyle).

Other modifications will be added soon which will include the following: -

1. Klicky PCB
2. Knomi Stealthburner face
3. BTT SB2209 integration via the umbilical mod provided by TheVoronModder (Kyle).

All files in the SLTs folder are what what have been modified from DaRk_dOg's Enderwire conversion.

SLT's for the modified files have been uploaded for those that would like to test fit. Regular updates are being made as we progress testing the updated parts we push out.
