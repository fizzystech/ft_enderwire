NOTE: Updated easy to build CAD file has finally been released. Look out for folders that have a suffix a or b. You will need to turn off one of the options to view the CAD in the configuration of your choice. The key areas where this applies are for the Cable Chains / Umbilical, Stealthburner / Knomi Stealthburner, Mini 12864 / TFT50 screen.

This is the FizzysTech take on the Enderwire conversion

This conversion is a modified version of DaRk_dOg's (boubounokefalos) conversion with a number of updates we all think should be made to the Switchwire.

We have incorporated the Nevermore V4 filter into the design and other changes from the stock design will be added in due time.

Umbilical mods to both the XZ and Y axis have been incorporated with the help of TheVoronModder (Kyle).

Other modifications will be added soon which will include the following: -

1. Klicky PCB
2. Knomi Stealthburner face
3. BTT SB2209 integration via the umbilical mod provided by TheVoronModder (Kyle).

All files in the SLTs folder are what what have been modified from DaRk_dOg's Enderwire conversion.

SLT's for the modified files have been uploaded for those that would like to test fit. Regular updates are being made as we progress testing the updated parts we push out.
