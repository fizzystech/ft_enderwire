# FT Enderwire

Welcome to Fizzy's take of the Enderwire (Ender 3 to Voron Switchwire conversion. Look out for folders that have a suffix a or b. You will need to turn off one of the options to view the CAD in the configuration of your choice. The key areas where this applies are for the Cable Chains / Umbilical, Stealthburner / Knomi Stealthburner, Mini 12864 / TFT50 screen.

This conversion is a modified version of DaRk_dOg's (boubounokefalos) conversion with a number of updates we all think should be made to the Switchwire.

Do visit the [wiki](https://github.com/fizzystech/ft_enderwire/wiki) for full details of how to use this guide and details on how to build and configure FT Enderwire.

Hope that you appreciate the amount of time and effort to come up with the FT version of the Enderwire.
