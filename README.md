# FT Enderwire

Welcome to Fizzy's take of the Enderwire (Ender 3 to Voron Switchwire conversion).

This conversion is a modified version of DaRk_dOg's (boubounokefalos) conversion with a number of updates we all think should be made to the Switchwire.

Do visit the [wiki](https://github.com/fizzystech/ft_enderwire/wiki) for full details of how to use this guide and details on how to build and configure FT Enderwire.

Hope that you appreciate the amount of time and effort to come up with the FT version of the Enderwire. If you like our work and would like to contribute to fund filaments and other equipment required for prototyping, please do so at my paypal (https://paypal.me/fizzystech) or Ko-fi (https://ko-fi.com/fizzystech). Your support is greatly appreciated and will fund updates and new projects :)
